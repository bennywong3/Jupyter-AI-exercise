    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, in the main tutorial of Module 5, we have studied the use of Q Learning in learning to navigate a taxi to pick up/drop off passengers. However, the problem is quite simple that there are only 500 states in the entire state space. Therefore, it is reasonable for you to wonder if the same Q Learning method would be able to solve more complicated problems, e.g., playing video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, although there are more advanced RL algorithms to play video games, it may be difficult for us to understand those algorithms if we immediately jump to there from Q Learning. As an intermediate step, this notebook introduces an example of the “Mountain Car” problem, which involves a state space with continuous state values, which already increases the difficulty of the problem when compared to the self-driving taxi problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces an enhancement of Q Learning, namely Deep Q Learning, in which a (deep) neural network called Deep Q Network is used to replace Q Table to improve its learning performance to handle more sophisticated problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completion of the tasks in this notebook, you would have gained the experience of implementing the Deep Q Learning algorithm, while appreciating the enhancement of RL algorithms with deep neural networks to handle more complicated applications. \n",

    "\n",
    "> A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two \"mountains\". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.\n",

Comparing with the “self-driving taxi” environment we have studied before, which has a finite discrete state space with just 500 states, the “Mountain Car” problem is comparable more difficult. If we only use Q Learning as we have attempted before, one probable problem is to describe the continuous state-action space with a discrete Q Table. "

    "\n",
    "Before we start studying DQL, let’s have a revision on (traditional) Q Learning:\n",

    "- Q-value of state-action pair $Q(s,a)$:\n",
    "    - __expected cumulative rewards__ of taking action $a$ at state $s$     \n",

    "    2. The learning agent start at the initial state $s_0$ (start of episode)\n",
    "    3. At each current state $s$, the learning agent decides to take action $a$, based on a random choice (exploration) or some Q-values ${\\rm argmax}_a(Q(s,a))$ (exploitation) \n",
    "    4. Update Q-value: $Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha (r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a'))-Q(s,a))$, where $r$ is the reward received when moving from the current state to the next state.\n",

    "## Deep Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Deep Q Network</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that, in (traditional) Q Learning, the objective of training is to train Q values to accurately estimate the expected cumulative rewards of state-action pairs, so that in the equation of Q Learning,     \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$Q(s,a) = r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a'))$,</center>    \n",
    "\n",
    "left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation will have similar values. However, the use of discrete Q Table to represent the expected cumulative rewards may not be the most effective, especially when the state-action space is of high complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DQL, $Q(s,a)$ is considered as a function, where the input of the function is a state-action pair, and the output is the corresponding expected cumulative rewards. Usually, we consider the function to have continuous input domain, so that we can handle continuous state space. \n",
    "\n",
    "By considering $Q(s,a)$ as a function, we can then train a neural network, a.k.a. __Deep Q Network (DQN)__, to predict the values of $Q(s,a)$. To train such a DQN network, network weights are trained according to the temporal difference error $\\delta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\delta = Q(s,a) - (r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a')))$ .</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by minimizing the temporal difference error $\\delta$, the difference between LHS $𝑄(𝑠,𝑎)$ (predicted Q values) and RHS $𝑟 + \\gamma\\max_{a'}(𝑄(𝑠’,𝑎’))$ (target Q values) of the Q Learning equation is also minimized. Consequently, the DQN will also give an accurate approximation of the expected cumulative rewards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is an example usage of ML methods for __Function Approximation__. Here, given inputs (state-action) and outputs (rewards from the environment), we train a neural network to approximate the underlying mapping function (assuming there is one). In this case, we are trying to replace the Q Table in traditional Q Learning with a deep neural network DQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Policy/Target Deep Q Networks</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our objective here is to approximate the Q Table with some deep neural network DQN, usually two neural networks are used during training instead of only one. The two DQNs involved are known as the Policy and Target networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As aforementioned, DQNs are trained by minimizing the temporal difference error $\\delta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\delta = Q(s,a) - (r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a')))$ .</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, if only one DQN is used, then this DQN will be used for predicting two types of Q values at the same time: 1) Q values of current state and action $Q(s,a)$, and 2) Q values of next state and the possible actions $Q(s',a')$, as in the target Q value $(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a')))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noteworthy that during training the network weights of the DQN keep changing, so as the two predicted Q values. Even if we adjust the network weights in a way that makes $Q(s,a)$ closer to the target Q value $(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a')))$ at this moment, after we update the network weights according to the temporal difference error $\\delta$, next time $Q(s,a)$ has to chase after a different target Q value. This makes it harder for the DQN to converge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, two DQNs called Policy network and Target network are used instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy network: \n",
    "    - Used for predicting $Q(s,a)$, to determine action based on current state\n",
    "    - Updated at every step of training\n",
    "- Target network: \n",
    "    - Used for predicting the target Q value $(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}(Q(s',a')))$\n",
    "    - Only updated once in a while, by copying weights of the Policy network at the moment\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in between two updates of the Target network, the target Q value is fixed so the Policy Network will have a clearer target. This helps stabilize training and fosters convergence of the Policy network. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Experience Replay</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that, in (traditional) Q Learning we have studied before, whenever an action is taken, the rewards received are used to update the Q values. In DQL, network weights of the DQN are updated in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL adopts the __Experience Replay__ approach. At each step, based on the state $𝑠$, action $𝑎$ is taken, reward $𝑟$ is received and the next state $𝑠’$ is observed. Usually, we call (state, action, reward, next_state) = $(s,a,r,s')$ as a transition. After recording this transition, instead of immediately using it to update DQN network weights, we first save the transition in a memory buffer. Later, training of DQN network is performed in a minibatch training fashion, that we (randomly) sample a batch of transitions from the memory buffer. Then, this batch of transitions is fed to DQN to train the network weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages of adopting the Experience Replay approach to update DQN network weights. However, they will not be discussed in this study (you may check the materials suggested in “Recommended Materials (Optional)”). To quickly summarize the advantages, Experience Replay enables more stable training of our neural network model DQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Algorithm of Deep Q Learning</u>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Previously in Module 5, we have studied the topic of Exploration-Exploitation trade-off, and we have studied the use of Epsilon-greedy policy to guide the RL model to manage the balance between exploration and exploitation. In the previous example we have studied, we only used a constant exploration probability for all the time during training. In this study, we use a decaying exploration probability which starts at a large probability and decays over time. This allows the DQN model to explore more states at the beginning, and then attempt to refine its learning when training goes on. \n",

    "One intuitive way to study how the DQN model learns during training is to plot the rewards received over episodes. The following figure shows the results of an attempt to train the DQN model above. Although there are signs showing the DQN model has learnt something (e.g., less frequent negative cumulative rewards near the end of training), they are hard to observe as the results are not stable and fluctuate in a large range.\n",

    "This is not uncommon while training and evaluating RL models (especially RL models using neural networks, like DQL). There are many reasons causing such fluctuation of performance, such as different initial game states and insufficient learning of the model (try to think about other reasons!). Therefore, to obtain more comprehensible results, one often consider taking the moving average of the evaluation metrics, like rewards this time. The following figure shows an example of computing the moving average of rewards with a window size of 30 episodes. The trend of model performance that is shown by a less fluctuating line is more interpretable this time. \n",

The procedure of simulating game play is essentially the same as the training procedure, except that the DQN network weights are frozen and you may display the game screen on the fly.
